Note on mssing WRPEL, WRUED, WRUEA frequency lists
==================================================
Note that WRPEL, WRUED and WRUEA are not included. These are the corpora
containing data from new media (e.g. chat, SMS). The parses are quite bad,
which is no surprise because these type of media are full of colloquial writing,
abbreviations, dialect - simply: non-standard Dutch. Lemma-tags and pt-tags are
missing in the Alpino-parsed corpus, therefore frequency lists could not be
generated for these corpora.
